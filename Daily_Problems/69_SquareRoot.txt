It was an Easy Problem..but i found it hard not hard as per say i was missing the overflow issue
it is a binary search problem i basically need to divide the range from 1 to x .
and then divide it into half and compare the[mid = left + (right - left) / 2 ]^2 with x, so that i an figure out one which side of the araay the square root might be there

while left <= right
if square == x {
    retuurn mid;//thats the answer only
}
else if(square) < x{
    left = mid + 1;
}
else{
    right = mid -1;
}
return right;
