This function reverses a string, but remember: the string is given as a character array (like ['h','e','l','l','o']).

🔍 What the function wants to do

Turn something like:

["h","e","l","l","o"]


into:

["o","l","l","e","h"]


— without creating a new array (this is called "in-place").

🔧 How the code works (simple explanation)
1️⃣ We use two fingers (pointers)

One finger starts at the beginning of the array → left = 0

Another finger starts at the end → right = s.length - 1

Imagine pointing to both ends of the word.

2️⃣ Swap the characters

Whatever character the left finger points to, swap it with what the right finger points to.

Example for "hello":

Left points to	Right points to	Swap result
h	o	o e l l h
3️⃣ Move the fingers inward

Left finger moves right → left++

Right finger moves left → right--

This continues until the fingers meet or cross.

4️⃣ Loop stops

When left >= right, we’re done.
At that point, the entire array has been reversed.

🧠 Why this works

We are swapping the outer characters first, then slowly moving inward until the whole string is reversed.
We never create another array — so memory usage stays O(1).
