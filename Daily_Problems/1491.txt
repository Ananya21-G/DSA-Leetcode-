Problem in Simple Words

You are given salaries of employees.
You must:

Remove the lowest salary

Remove the highest salary

Find the average of the remaining salaries

Key Idea

Instead of sorting the array, we can do everything in one loop:

Find minimum salary

Find maximum salary

Find total sum

Then subtract the minimum and maximum from the sum and divide by the remaining count.

What Each Variable Means

min → stores the smallest salary

max → stores the largest salary

sum → stores the sum of all salaries

Step-by-Step Working
Step 1: Initialize values

Assume the first salary is both minimum and maximum initially.

Example:
salary = [4000, 3000, 1000, 2000]

min = 4000
max = 4000
sum = 0

Step 2: Loop through salaries

For every salary:

Add it to sum

Update min if current salary is smaller

Update max if current salary is larger

After loop:

sum = 10000
min = 1000
max = 4000

Step 3: Remove min and max from sum
sum - min - max = 10000 - 1000 - 4000 = 5000

Step 4: Divide by remaining employees

We removed 2 salaries (min & max):

remaining employees = salary.length - 2
= 4 - 2 = 2

Step 5: Final average
average = 5000 / 2 = 2500.0

Why We Use (double)

Java divides integers as integers.
Casting to double ensures we get decimal precision.

Final Formula to Remember (Exam Gold ✨)
Average = (Total Sum − Min − Max) / (n − 2)

“Add everything, remove extremes, divide by remaining.”
