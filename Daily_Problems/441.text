Row 1 → 1 coin  
Row 2 → 2 coins  
Row 3 → 3 coins  
Row 4 → 4 coins  
...
As k increases, the required coins:

k(k+1)/2

mid = our guess of how many rows we can build (k)

need = mid*(mid+1)/2 = coins needed for mid rows

We compare:
If need == n → perfect match → return mid
If need < n → we can try more rows → move left
If need > n → we tried too many rows → move right
When the loop ends, right holds the correct k.
