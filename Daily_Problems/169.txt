LeetCode 169 — Majority Element (Documentation)
✅ Problem Summary

Given an integer array nums, return the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
It is guaranteed that such an element always exists.

🧠 Brain Note (Memory Anchor)

✅ Pattern name: Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm
✅ When to use: When an element appears more than n/2 times (majority guaranteed)
✅ Core idea: Keep a candidate and cancel out different elements using a count

✅ Approach Used: Boyer–Moore Voting
Key Variables

candidate → the current possible majority element

count → balance of votes for the candidate

Logic

Start with count = 0

Traverse each number num:

If count == 0, make num the new candidate

If num == candidate, increase count

Else decrease count (cancels a vote)

At the end, candidate is the majority element

✅ Why This Works

Since the majority element appears more than half, it cannot be completely cancelled by other elements.
So it will always survive as the final candidate.

⏱ Complexity

✅ Time: O(n) (single pass through array)
✅ Space: O(1) (only two variables)

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {

        // candidate will store the possible majority element
        int candidate = 0;

        // count tracks the "vote balance" for the current candidate
        int count = 0;

        // Traverse each number in the array
        for (int num : nums) {

            // If count is 0, we pick the current number as the new candidate
            // (because the previous candidate got fully cancelled out)
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }

            // If current number matches candidate, give it a vote (+1)
            if (candidate == num) {
                count++;
            }
            // Otherwise, cancel one vote (-1)
            else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        // Since majority element is guaranteed to exist,
        // the final candidate is the answer
        return candidate;
    }
}
