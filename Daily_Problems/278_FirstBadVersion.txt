problem from easy section of binary search.
just imagine a sorted array from 1 to n ,and one becomes faulty and after that all of it becomes faulty . so we need to  find the first faulty one.
we will define left = 1;right=n;and a mid = left + (right - left)/2;
while (left < right)//remember left cant be equal to right ..time will exceed
    if (isBadVersion(mid)){
        right = mid;
    }else {
        left = mid + 1;
    }
    return anything left or right;
