✅ Layman Explanation of the Code
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        Long first = null, second = null, third = null;

✔ What this means:

We want to keep track of the top 3 distinct maximum numbers.

So we create:

first → the largest number

second → the second-largest distinct number

third → the third-largest distinct number

We use Long (not int) so that we can safely store values and also allow null initially (meaning “not assigned yet”).

        for (int n : nums) {
            long num = n;

✔ What this does:

We loop through every number in the array.

num just converts n into a long for comparison.

            if (first != null && num == first ||
                second != null && num == second ||
                third != null && num == third) continue;

✔ Meaning in simple terms:

If we have already seen this number, we skip it.
We want distinct maximums — duplicates do not count.

Example:
Array: [2, 2, 3] → the two 2s should not be treated separately.

            if (first == null || num > first) {
                third = second;
                second = first;
                first = num;

✔ Meaning:

If this number is bigger than the current biggest (first):

The old second becomes third

The old first becomes second

This new number becomes first

💡 Example:
Numbers seen so far: [10, 7, 5]
Then new number = 12
→ 12 becomes first
→ 10 moves to second
→ 7 moves to third

            } else if (second == null || num > second) {
                third = second;
                second = num;

✔ Meaning:

If it is not the biggest, but bigger than the second biggest:

Move old second to third

Set this number as new second

💡 Example:
Seen: first=12, second=10
New number = 11
→ second becomes 11
→ third becomes 10

            } else if (third == null || num > third) {
                third = num;
            }
        }

✔ Meaning:

If it’s not the 1st or 2nd largest, but still bigger than the 3rd largest, update third.

        return third == null ? first.intValue() : third.intValue();
    }
}

✔ Final Decision:

If we found a third distinct maximum, return it.

If not (means array had fewer than 3 distinct numbers), return the largest number.

Example:

Input: [3, 2, 1]
→ third max = 1

Input: [1, 2]
→ Only two distinct values.
→ Return the biggest: 2
