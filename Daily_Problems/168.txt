✅ What this code is trying to do (big picture)

This code converts a number into an Excel column name.

Examples:

1 → A

26 → Z

27 → AA

28 → AB

Excel works like alphabets instead of digits, and it starts counting from 1, not 0. That’s the only tricky part.

✅ class Solution {

Just the class required by LeetCode. Nothing special here.

✅ public String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {

This function:

Takes a number (columnNumber)

Returns a String (Excel column title)

Example input: 28
Example output: "AB"

✅ StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

We create an empty object called result to store letters one by one.

Why not a normal string?
👉 Because strings are slow to modify, StringBuilder is faster and better for appending characters.

✅ while (columnNumber > 0) {

We keep running this loop until the number becomes 0.

Each loop:

Finds one letter

Removes that part from the number

✅ columnNumber--;

⚠ VERY IMPORTANT LINE

Excel columns start at:

A = 1
But programming indexes start at:

A = 0

So we subtract 1 to match:

1 → 0 (A)
26 → 25 (Z)


Without this line, the code will give wrong answers.

✅ columnNumber % 26

This gives a number between 0 and 25.

Example:

0 → A

1 → B

25 → Z

This is how we decide which letter to add.

✅ (char)('A' + columnNumber % 26)

This converts the number into a letter.

Examples:

'A' + 0 → 'A'

'A' + 1 → 'B'

'A' + 25 → 'Z'

So this line finds the correct Excel letter.

✅ result.append(...)

Adds the letter to result.

⚠ Important:
We are adding letters from right to left.

Example for 28:

First letter added → 'B'

Then 'A'
So result becomes "BA"

✅ columnNumber /= 26;

This removes the last processed letter and moves to the next digit (like moving left in a number).

Example:

28 → 27 → 1

✅ } (end of loop)

The loop continues until columnNumber becomes 0.

✅ return result.reverse().toString();

Because letters were added backwards, we reverse them at the end.

Example:

"BA" → "AB"


Then convert it to a normal string and return it.

🎯 Final Intuition (One-Line Memory Trick)

👉 This code keeps taking the last Excel letter, converts it to a character, stores it, and removes it from the number until nothing is left.

✅ Example Walkthrough: columnNumber = 28
Step	   Value	    Letter Found	result
1	       28 → 27	        B	          "B"
2	       1 → 0	        A	          "BA"
reverse	   —	            —	          "AB"


Key Things to Remember

✔ Excel columns are 1-based, not 0-based
✔ Always subtract 1 before % 26
✔ Build the answer backwards, then reverse
