        }

        // After finding the two largest numbers:
        // Apply the formula (max1 - 1) * (max2 - 1)
        return (max1 - 1) * (max2 - 1);
    }

✅ Quick Summary of the Approach
The maximum product comes from the two largest numbers.

Instead of sorting (O(n log n)), we find them in one pass (O(n)).

Then apply the formula:


(max1−1)∗(max2−1)
