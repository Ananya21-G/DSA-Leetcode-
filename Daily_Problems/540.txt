Logic of the Problem

The array is sorted.

Every element appears exactly twice, except one element which appears once.

Because elements are in pairs, each pair occupies two consecutive positions.

If no unique element existed, then:

pairs would look like:
index: 0 1 | 2 3 | 4 5 | ...
value: a a | b b | c c | ...


So, for every pair, the first element is at an even index, and the second at the next odd index.

Where the Unique Element Causes a Break

When the single element appears, this even-odd pairing pattern breaks.

Example:

[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
         ↑ unique


Before the unique element:

Pairs are normal → start at even index.

After the unique element:

Indexing becomes shifted → pairs start at odd index.

Binary Search Logic

Use binary search to find where the pairing breaks.

Always force mid to be even so we compare nums[mid] with nums[mid + 1].

Check Pattern:

If nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]
→ Pair is correct → unique is to the right → move low = mid + 2

If nums[mid] != nums[mid + 1]
→ Pair is broken → unique is to the left or at mid → move high = mid

Continue until low == high, which is the position of the single element.

Core Insight (One Line):

The unique element is located at the first index where the normal even-indexed pairing pattern fails.
