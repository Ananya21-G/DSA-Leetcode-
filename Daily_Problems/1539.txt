Problem Goal

We want to find the k-th missing positive number from a strictly increasing array of positive integers.

Key Insight

For any index mid in the array:

Missing numbers before arr[mid] = arr[mid] - (mid + 1)


Why?

If there were no missing numbers, then ideally:

At index 0 → value = 1

At index 1 → value = 2

At index 2 → value = 3
and so on…

So at index mid, the expected value is mid + 1.

If the value is bigger than expected, the difference tells how many numbers are missing.

Example

Index:      0  1  2  3
Array:      2  3  4  7
Expected:   1  2  3  4
Difference: 1  1  1  3

Missing counts are: arr[mid] - (mid + 1)


So:

At index 3: arr[3] = 7
Missing count = 7 - (3+1) = 3
Meaning 3 numbers are missing before 7 → {1, 5, 6}

Binary Search Logic

We use binary search to find the first index in the array where the missing count becomes >= k.

If missing < k, we need to search right side → set left = mid + 1

If missing >= k, we search left side → set right = mid

When the loop ends, left will be the smallest index where missing numbers have reached k.

Finally,

Answer = left + k


Because for all indices before left, exactly left numbers are present, so the missing number shifts ahead by left.

Documented Code
class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {

        // We will use binary search to find the smallest index
        // where the count of missing numbers becomes >= k
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length;

        while (left < right) {

            // mid index
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Count how many numbers are missing before arr[mid]
            // missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1)
            if (arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k) {
                // Missing count is still less than k,
                // so we need to move to the right half
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Missing count is >= k, move to left half
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        // At this point, left tells how many numbers from the array are <= answer
        // So the k-th missing number is shifted ahead by 'left'
        return left + k;
    }
}

Quick Memory Trick

arr[mid] - (mid + 1) → missing count before mid
Compare missing count with k and binary search like normal.
