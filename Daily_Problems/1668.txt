Maximum Repeating Substring
📌 Problem Summary

You are given two strings:

sequence

word

A string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times (word × k) appears as a substring of sequence.

Your task is to return the maximum value of k for which this condition holds.

If word never appears in sequence, return 0.

🧠 Key Definitions

Substring → Continuous characters (no skipping).

k-repeating → word must repeat consecutively.

Maximum k → Stop at the first failure.

🧠 Brain Note (Memory Anchor)

Pattern: Incremental string growth
When to use: Finding max consecutive repetition of a pattern
Core idea: Keep appending word and test substring existence

💡 Intuition

Instead of scanning indices or using complex pattern matching:

Start with word

Check if it exists in sequence

If yes → append word again

Repeat until it fails

The moment word × (k+1) is not found, the answer is k.

Because the constraints are small (≤ 100), a greedy incremental approach is ideal.

🧪 Example Walkthrough
Input
sequence = "ababc"
word = "ab"

Checks
Attempt	Repeated String	Exists?
k=1	"ab"	✅
k=2	"abab"	✅
k=3	"ababab"	❌
Output
2

🛠️ Algorithm

Initialize k = 0

Set repeated = word

While sequence.contains(repeated):

Increment k

Append word to repeated

Return k

✅ Java Implementation
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String sequence, String word) {
        int k = 0;
        String repeated = word;

        while (sequence.contains(repeated)) {
            k++;
            repeated += word;
        }

        return k;
    }
}

🧩 Why This Works

String.contains() checks for substring, exactly what we need

Each loop increases repetition by one

First failure guarantees previous k was the maximum valid value

⏱️ Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity:
O(n²) in the worst case
(safe because n ≤ 100)

Space Complexity:
O(n) due to the growing repeated string

⚠️ Edge Cases
Case	Result
word not in sequence	0
sequence == word	1
word.length() > sequence.length()	0
Single character repeats	Works correctly
🎯 Interview Notes

If asked “Can this be optimized?”, say:

Yes, KMP or DP can optimize pattern matching, but given small constraints, this greedy solution is the cleanest and most readable.

🧠 Final Takeaway

This problem is not about clever algorithms —
it’s about recognizing repetition and stopping at the right time.
