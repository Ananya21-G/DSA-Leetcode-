LeetCode 1295 — Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
🧩 Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers, determine how many numbers in the array contain an even number of digits.

🧠 Approach Overview

The key idea is to count the number of digits in each integer and check whether that count is even.

We process the array one number at a time, apply digit counting, and maintain a counter for numbers that satisfy the condition.

🔍 Digit Counting Logic

To count digits in a number:

Repeatedly divide the number by 10

Each division removes one digit

Count how many times this operation is performed until the number becomes 0

Example:

7896 → 789 → 78 → 7 → 0
Digits = 4

🧪 Example Walkthrough
Input
[12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]

Number	Digits	Even?
12	2	✅
345	3	❌
2	1	❌
6	1	❌
7896	4	✅
Output
2

🛠️ Algorithm Steps

Initialize a counter to store the result.

Iterate through each number in the array.

For each number:

Count its digits using division by 10.

Check if the digit count is even.

If even, increment the counter.

Return the final counter value.

💻 Java Implementation
class Solution {
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int digits = 0;
            int temp = num;

            while (temp > 0) {
                digits++;
                temp = temp / 10;
            }

            if (digits % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

⏱️ Complexity Analysis
Metric	Value
Time Complexity	O(n × d) where d is number of digits
Space Complexity	O(1)

Since the maximum number of digits is small (≤ 6), the algorithm is efficient.

🧠 Brain Note (Memory Anchor)

Pattern: Digit Counting

When to use: When conditions depend on number length

Core idea: Division by 10 removes one digit at a time

✅ Key Takeaways

This problem is more about number properties than arrays.

Digit counting using division is reliable and intuitive.

Always separate logic understanding from code writing.
