it was a new kinda problem .was simple takes time to grasp of the problem (atleast for me)
so we are told that we number is choosen between 1 to n
and we need to guess it 
so we are chosing BINARY SEARCH
and we are given an API(a funnction which will check if the number is lower, higher, or we it is the number)
so we find mid = low + (high - low) /2;
and we store the mid in int ans = guess(mid)
this ans will be checked if it is 1, -1, or 0
if(ans == 0){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(ans == -1){
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else{
                low = mid + 1;
            }
and the number will be guessed in the loop so as we "HAVE TO" return at the end so we can just retuen 1.
