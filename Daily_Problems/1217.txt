int evens = 0, odds = 0;  
// We create two counters:
// evens → number of chips placed at even positions
// odds  → number of chips placed at odd positions

for (int p : position) {  
    // Loop through every chip’s position in the array
    if (p % 2 == 0)  
        evens++;      // If position is even, increase evens count
    else  
        odds++;       // If position is odd, increase odds count
}

// Key idea:
// Moving chips between positions of SAME parity (even→even or odd→odd) has cost 0.
// Only moving between different parities costs 1 per chip.
//
// So we choose the cheaper parity to move all chips to.
// This cost will be equal to the number of chips on the minority side.
return Math.min(evens, odds);
// Return the minimum number of chips that need to switch parity.
// That will be the minimum total cost.
🎯 Simple Explanation
Chips on even positions can reach any other even position for free.

Chips on odd positions can reach any other odd position for free.

Only when you switch from even ↔ odd, you pay a cost of 1.

So:

If you have more chips on even, move all chips to an even position.

If you have more chips on odd, move all chips to an odd position.

The minimum cost = number of chips on the smaller parity group.

✔ Example
If position = [1,2,3]

Odds = chips at 1, 3 → 2 chips

Evens = chip at 2 → 1 chip

Move the smaller group (evens) to odd → cost = 1.
