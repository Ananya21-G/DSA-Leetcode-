✅ Super Simple Explanation (in English)
Think of the string as a line of characters.

You place one finger on the left, and another on the right.

Move both fingers inward.

Skip anything that is not a letter or number (like spaces, commas, symbols).

Compare the characters:

If they don’t match → not a palindrome.

If you reach the middle without mismatch → it is a palindrome.

This method is fast and clean because you don’t create any new strings
