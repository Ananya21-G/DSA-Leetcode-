🧠 Quick Intuition (Super Simple Explanation)
Imagine you are arranging a line of students sorted by height.

Some students with the same height appear multiple times.

You want to make a line where each height appears only once.

You don’t remove anyone physically.
You simply move unique heights to the front of the line.

Here’s how the pointers behave:

i → points to the position where the next unique height should go

j → scans each student one by one

Whenever j finds a new height different from the one at i, you:

move i forward

put that new height at i

At the end, everything before i+1 is unique.
