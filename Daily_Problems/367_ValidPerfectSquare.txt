left = 1, right = num: We search the possible square root range between 1 and num.

while(left <= right): Perform binary search.

mid = left + (right - left) / 2: Find the midpoint to avoid overflow.

sq = mid * mid: Calculate the square of mid.

if (sq == num): If perfect square found → return true.

else if (sq < num): If square is too small → move search to right half (left = mid + 1).

else: If square is too large → move search to left half (right = mid - 1).

If loop ends → no integer squared equals num → return false.
