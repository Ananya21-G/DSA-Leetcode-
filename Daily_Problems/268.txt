🧠 Brain Note (Memory Anchor)

Pattern name: Missing element from fixed range

When to use: One missing number, no duplicates, known bounds

Core idea: Compare ideal complete set with given set → isolate the difference

🧩 Key Observations

The range is fixed: 0 → n

Total numbers that should exist: n + 1

Numbers actually present: n

Therefore, exactly one number is missing

Order of elements does not matter

This tells us we should aggregate information, not sort or search.

🛠️ Solution Strategy 1: Sum Difference (Intuitive)
Idea

The numbers from 0 to n form an arithmetic progression

The total sum of this range is fixed

The array’s sum is smaller by exactly the missing number

Logic
missing number = (sum of 0..n) − (sum of array)

Why this works

Every number except the missing one contributes equally to both sums.

When to use

Easy to explain

Constraints are small enough to avoid overflow

🛠️ Solution Strategy 2: XOR Cancellation (Interview-Grade)
XOR properties you must remember

x ^ x = 0 → same values cancel

x ^ 0 = x → zero does nothing

XOR is order independent

Core Insight

If you XOR:

all numbers from 0 to n

with all numbers in the array

Then:

every number that appears twice cancels out

the missing number appears once → remains

Mental Model

Think of XOR as pair cancellation:

Expected set: 0,1,2,3,...,n
Actual set:   same, except one missing

Everything cancels except the missing number

Why XOR is powerful

No risk of overflow

Truly O(1) space

Clean and elegant

Frequently expected in interviews

🧪 Example Walkthrough (XOR)

Input:

nums = [3, 0, 1]
n = 3


XOR everything:

(0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3) ^ (3 ^ 0 ^ 1)


Pairs cancel:

0 cancels
1 cancels
3 cancels
→ left with 2


Answer: 2

🧠 Pattern Recognition Checklist

Ask yourself these questions:

Is the range fixed and known?

Is exactly one value missing?

Are there no duplicates?

Do I need O(1) space?

If yes → Sum or XOR pattern

🧠 Final One-Line Insight (Sticky Memory)

When the problem gives you a perfect world (0..n) and a broken world (array),
don’t search — subtract or cancel.
