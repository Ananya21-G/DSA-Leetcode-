Problem: Assign Cookies (Greedy Algorithm)
Goal

Given:

g[i] → greed factor of the i-th child (minimum cookie size required)

s[j] → size of the j-th cookie

Each child can get at most one cookie, and a cookie can be used only once.

Objective: Maximize the number of content children.

Key Idea (Greedy Strategy)

To satisfy as many children as possible, we:

Try to satisfy the least greedy child first

Use the smallest cookie that can satisfy them

This prevents wasting large cookies on small needs.

Algorithm Steps

Sort the greed array g in ascending order

Sort the cookie array s in ascending order

Use two pointers:

i → points to children

j → points to cookies

Compare current child and cookie:

If cookie size ≥ child greed → assign cookie, move both pointers

Else → cookie too small, move cookie pointer only

Count every successful assignment

Why Sorting Works

Sorting helps us match the smallest possible cookie to the least greedy child

This ensures optimal use of cookies

Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity:
O(n log n + m log m)
(sorting both arrays)

Space Complexity:
O(1) extra space (in-place sorting)

Example Walkthrough
Example 1
g = [1, 2, 3]
s = [1, 1]


After sorting:

g = [1, 2, 3]
s = [1, 1]


Assignments:

child 1 ← cookie 1 ✅

child 2 ← cookie 1 ❌

✅ Output: 1

Example 2
g = [1, 2]
s = [1, 2, 3]


After sorting:

g = [1, 2]
s = [1, 2, 3]


Assignments:

child 1 ← cookie 1 ✅

child 2 ← cookie 2 ✅

✅ Output: 2
